Make sure the minimum requirement for artifactory is met (2 gb ram) for basic testing
Step1: Install Java and set Java Home
install java
yum install java-1.8* -y
java -version
vi .bash_profile
JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.265.b01-1.amzn2.0.1.x86_64
PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME:$HOME/bin
source ~/.bash_profile
echo $JAVA_HOME

Step2: Setup Artifactory and set the artifactory path and start the service
wget https://bintray.com/jfrog/artifactory-rpms/rpm -O bintray-jfrog-artifactory-rpms.repo
mv bintray-jfrog-artifactory-rpms.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/
sudo yum install jfrog-artifactory-oss

Set the artifactory path
/opt/jfrog/artifactory
echo "export ARTIFACTORY_HOME=/opt/jfrog/artifactory" >> /etc/profile
. /etc/profile
env | grep ARTIFACTORY
service artifactory start
service atrifactory status

Testing the artifactory by running the instance
13.233.252.195:8081
user:admin
password:password
Reset the password

Step 3: Integrate with Jenkins and create a job for storing Artifactory
Create a new repository
Configuration->Repository->New Local Repository->select artifactory type (maven)

Setup artifactory plug-in - Artifactory
Configure the artifactory server
Manage Jenkins->Configure System->Artifactory
ServerID: artifactory
URL: http://13.233.252.195:8081/artifactory
UserName and Password (password that is reset when logging into artifactory for first time)
If any other user is setup in artifactory, then we can provide the username and password here

Creating repository for Maven project
Create a new item
Job Name : oceanLife-project
Git URL : https://github.com/chris-pat-box/OceanLife.git
Build Environment
Build: pom.xml
Build - Goals: clean install
Post-build Actions
Deploy Artifacts to Artifactory : 
artifact details that we setup in earlier step automatically comes here.
When click on Refresh Repositories - target releases and target snapshot repositories are populated
Build the Item

once build is successfull, we can see the war file inside 
libs-snapshot-local-><package path in project>->webapp->1.0-SNAPSHOT-><name-buildID>.war
